Hello, I'm Romain Calascibetta, developer and member of the
[MirageOS Core team][mirage]. I mainly do OCaml, some C and I like drawing,
guitar and politics. Here is my blog for my notes about MirageOS and OCaml and
some little notes in French for sure.

You can check what I do on GitHub or on [din.osau.re][din.osau.re]. Finally,
you can follow me on [twitter][twitter] and [Mastodon][mastodon]. If you want
to do a epistolary exchange with me, you can send me an email to:
