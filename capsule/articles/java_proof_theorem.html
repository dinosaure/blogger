  <h2>Implementing a minimalist mathematical statement prover with Java</h2>
  <blockquote>
<p>Proving things, like mathematical expressions, is serious
business. But in general, the theory behind attempted <em>automatic
proving</em> is often barbarically complex. To demystify the exercise, I
decided that my first article would be about writing an automatic
demonstrator of mathematical expressions, in Java, because Java
Champions (which I dream of becoming) write programs in Java.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To prove a mathematical statement, it is first important to be able to
describe in which <strong>system of axioms</strong> the statement is to be
validated. Next, it is necessary to describe the <strong>model</strong> used. And
yes, even if one would like each axiomatized theory to lead to only
one model... this is unfortunately not the case. Typically, there are
several models that validate <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assiomi_di_Peano">Peano's
arithmetic</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, to provide a <em>flexible automatic prover</em>, the class describing
the <em>validation engine</em> will need to be <strong>parametrised</strong> by several
other classes. Either, cleverly use <strong>parametric polymorphism</strong> (the
<em>intellectual</em> name of <em>Generics</em>, probably what a Java Champion would
say). Well, we can broadly sketch the outline of our prover! For this,
we will describe them in an <strong>interface</strong>!</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package io.github.xhtmlboi;

import java.util.Optional;

public interface Prover&lt;Axioms, Model, Statement&gt;  {

    Axioms getAxioms();
    Model getModel();

    /**
     * A statement that must be verified in the given axioms,
     * for the given model
     * @param st the statement
     * @return Returns an optional containing the result of
     *         the statement validation. (true for valid, false
     *         for invalid), if the optional is empty, the
     *          statement could not be validated or refuted.
     */
    Optional&lt;Boolean&gt; run(Statement st);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Well this is strange! Why return an optional boolean
(<code>Optional&lt;Boolean&gt;</code>)? A statement is valid or not, what a shame! Here
is a very <strong>detailed</strong> diagram of what <em>we would like</em>:</p>
<p><img src="/images/proof-aut.png" alt="a pretty ambitious goal" /></p>
<p>But in <strong>1936</strong>, on the basis of the incomprehensible (for the
<em>not-Java-Champion</em> that I am) paper &quot;<strong><em>Über formal unentscheidbare
Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme</em></strong>&quot; written by
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a> in 1931,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan
Turing</a> tackled the famous
<strong><em>Entscheidungsproblem</em></strong> (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz">Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz</a>,
yeah, the guy behind the monads, nah not those from the category
theory, others, about <em>soul stuff</em>). This leads to some rather
annoying problems, <em>or at least sets in stone</em> that some dreams (of
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert">Hildebert</a>'s for
example) will remain dreams <strong>forever</strong>. Transforming our perspectives
in this way:</p>
<p><img src="/images/proof.png" alt="What a mess" /></p>
<p>Now you should understand (unless you were a Java Champion and you
would have already understood) why use an option?</p>
<ul>
<li><code>result.get() == true</code> the statement is <strong>valid</strong>;
</li>
<li><code>result.get() == false</code> the statement is <strong>invalid</strong>;
</li>
<li><code>result.isEmpty()</code> the prover <strong>cannot</strong> validate the statement.
</li>
</ul>
<p>But what about the <strong>nonterminaison</strong>? Just think about it... if we
<strong>can't prove that a program terminates</strong>... how could we ask our
statement checker to tell us that the statement does not terminate?
But don't panic, the concrete implementation I will give you can
<strong>never</strong> nonterminate! Without further ado, here is a class that
implements our interface, let me introduce &quot;<strong>Ein Super Automatischer
Prüfer Der Immer Fertig Wird</strong>&quot; (Some will notice how I want to avoid
controversy by deliberately choosing a name that has no ambiguous
connotations in another language. A little tip, if you want to find a
name for a project and you absolutely want to avoid offending someone,
or a whole community... nothing could be easier, translate a sentence
into German):</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package io.github.xhtmlboi;

import java.util.Optional;

public class EinSuperAutomatischerPrüferDerImmerFertigWird&lt;Axioms, Model, Statement&gt; 
        implements Prover&lt;Axioms, Model, Statement&gt; {

    protected Axioms axioms;
    protected Model model;
    
    public EinSuperAutomatischerPrüferDerImmerFertigWird(Axioms axioms, Model model) {
        this.axioms = axioms;
        this.model = model;
    }

    @Override
    public Axioms getAxioms() {
        return this.axioms;
    }

    @Override
    public Model getModel() {
        return this.model;
    }

    @Override
    public Optional&lt;Boolean&gt; run(Statement st) {
        return Optional.empty();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>To avoid the risk of evaluating a statement that may not
finish... just don't evaluate it and always return an acceptable
answer: &quot;<strong>I don't know</strong>&quot;. According to Gödel, Church and
Turing... this answer is <strong>quite acceptable</strong> (sometimes... but all the
time is &quot;<em>a kind of sometimes</em>&quot;).</p>
<p>It's great, by respecting all the principles of <strong>Clean Code</strong>, using
a hint of design pattern and showing an uncommon intelligence, we
have, in few lines (which, in Java is a feat), succeeded in building a
very formal software that always returns the <strong>right answer</strong>. The
least I can say is that <strong>Java excels at this kind of exercise</strong>! You
should use it often. Another positive point is that this software can
probably run on any machine (provided it has a JVM installation
compatible with the byte code of the distributed software). And, even
more <em>deep</em>, because the verification algorithm is so clear, it is
possible <strong>to run it without a JVM</strong>*... and even without a computer. For
example... close your eyes, think very hard about a mathematical
statement, <strong>then simply say to yourself that you have no idea of the
validity of that statement</strong>. <em>So far so good</em>.</p>
<p>To conclude... is this software useful? Probably not for
<em>intelligently</em> checking mathematical statements or programs. But it
has the merit to demonstrate my quality as a Java programmer and my
<strong>eligibility to become a Champion</strong>. Although the lack of explicit
sums (as opposed to products) forces me to use an optional, rather
than an explcite sum: <code>Valid | Invalid | Dont_know</code>, but hey, that's
just functional programmer's flair.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this, and see you soon for new articles!</p>
