    <h1>Pasteur is up!</h1>
    <ul class="tags-list"><li>OCaml</li><li>MirageOS</li><li>unikernel</li></ul><p>After much experimentation with OCaml, <code>js_of_ocaml</code> and MirageOS, Pasteur is
finally updated to contain only OCaml code. Indeed, I keep in mind the goal to
do everything in OCaml!</p>
<p>Pasteur is a good unikernel to experiment with what is possible with OCaml. The
first difficulty with Pasteur was the multipart form. I was <em>lucky</em> to spend 5
years reading RFCs to finally implement <code>multipart_form</code>. The second difficulty
was JavaScript. Like <a href="https://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php%3Azerobin">zerobin</a>, I wanted to have the ability to paste
and <strong>encrypt</strong> content on the client side. I ended up experimenting quite a
bit with <a href="https://github.com/dbuenzli/brr"><code>brr</code></a>. Then, I had the opportunity to integrate another project
that fulfilled a specific use case: having a read-only file system to hold the
CSS and JavaScript files that the HTTP server would transmit. It was also a
question of parting with Conduit once and for all. Finally, with MirageOS 4,
the goal was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prendre des p'tits bouts d'trucs et puis les assembler ensemble</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this article we will explain all these points one by one and give an
overview of the ecosystem and what is finally possible with MirageOS.</p>
<h2 id="multipart_form-rfcs-and-ecosystem"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#multipart_form-rfcs-and-ecosystem"></a><code>multipart_form</code>, RFCs and ecosystem</h2>
<p>From my experience with email, I was able to read <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt">RFC 2045</a> (and its
sequel) which explains the <code>multipart/form</code> format. The latter is used by HTTP
1.1 (and it seems to me H2) to transmit information from an HTML form. There
are several ways of transmitting this information, by a GET request and a URL
which encodes the information (<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>) or by a
POST request which encodes in its content, in <code>multipart/form</code> format, this
information.</p>
<p>The latter is preferred in particular for its ability to upload files. As far
as emails are concerned, it is through this method that one can transmit an
attachment for example.</p>
<p>There are mainly 2 difficulties with the multipart/form format:</p>
<ol>
<li>format recursion, a multipart/form can contain a multipart/form</li>
<li>transmission of content without exploding the memory</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recursion"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recursion"></a>Recursion</h3>
<p>I blogged a whole day to really understand after 6 months of reading RFCs, we
could put an email in an email. But more globally, the multipart format is not
a linear description of several contents but a tree of contents!</p>
<p>The real problem with this encoding is that recursion is not discovered through
a formal definition of this format but through a description...</p>
<pre><code class="language-bnf">multipart-body := [preamble CRLF]
                  dash-boundary transport-padding CRLF
                  body-part *encapsulation
                  close-delimiter transport-padding
                  [CRLF epilogue]

body-part := MIME-part-headers [CRLF *OCTET]

encapsulation := delimiter transport-padding
                 CRLF body-part
</code></pre>
<p>Looking at this description, we can say that <code>multipart/form</code> is only a
succession (see <code>encapsulation</code>) of <code>body-part</code>. We can reduce this format to a
list of <code>OCTET</code>s associated with metadata (<code>MIME-part-headers</code>).</p>
<p>But that's without counting the next paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of a media type of &quot;multipart&quot; in a body part within another
&quot;multipart&quot; entity is explicitly allowed.  In such cases, for obvious
reasons, care must be taken to ensure that each nested &quot;multipart&quot;
entity uses a different boundary delimiter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this description, <code>OCTET</code> can contain a multipart/form so...</p>
<h3 id="memory-consumption-and-streams"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#memory-consumption-and-streams"></a>Memory consumption and streams</h3>
<p>The other essential point of <a href="https://github.com/dinosaure/multipart_form"><code>multipart_form</code></a> is its ability,
not to output the contents of the form as they are, but a <strong>stream</strong> of these
contents. Indeed, in the case of uploading a file, we would not want to store
all the content in memory and then process it but rather let the user decide
how to consume the upload of the said file.</p>
<p>In this way, the <code>multipart/form</code> must be parsed and the content transmitted at
the same time - so that the user can consume/save it somewhere at the same
time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">val both : unit fiber * unit fiber -&gt; unit fiber
val save_into_random_file : string stream -&gt; unit fiber

let post http_body =
  let `Parse fiber, stream_of_contents = Multipart_form.parse http_body in
  let save () = Stream.get stream_of_contents &gt;&gt;= function
    | None -&gt; return ()
    | Some stream -&gt; save_into_file stream &gt;&gt;= save in
  both fiber (save ())
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the decoding of the multipart document is done in conjunction
with saving the contents in random files. If the code runs, it can limit memory
consumption to a ceiling regardless of the size of the files sent.</p>
<p><img src="../images/multipart.png" alt="multipart" ></p>
<p>The image is not of good quality and the information is not clear, but one can
note in ordinate the memory consumption and in abcissa, the time. We can see
that we have spikes that reach a ceiling. This is the case where we save part
of the file in memory and as soon as we reach the ceiling, we execute the
<code>save</code> function which consumes the file.</p>
<h3 id="the-multipart_project-project"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-multipart_project-project"></a>The <code>multipart_project</code> project</h3>
<p>I would really like to thank <a href="https://github.com/Armael">ArmaÃ«l</a> who helped me work on the API and
make sure of these memory consumption aspects. Anyway, the project ended up
being integrated into <a href="https://github.com/aantron/dream">Dream</a>. It is available here:
<a href="https://github.com/dinosaure/multipart_form">multipart_form</a></p>
<h2 id="js_of_ocaml-brr-and-security"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#js_of_ocaml-brr-and-security"></a>Js_of_ocaml, <code>brr</code> and security</h2>
<p>One of Pasteurr's goals was to follow <a href="https://sebsauvage.net/wiki/doku.php?id=php%3Azerobin">zerobin</a> in his design. The
goal is that the server should not store the paste in clear text and that the
only person in possession of the encryption key is the author of the paste.</p>
<p>The trick is to encrypt the content directly in the webbrowser and to transmit
only the encrypted content to the server (with POST and <code>multipart_form</code>).
Then, in JavaScript, we can ask (still on the client side) to redirect the
client to the result of its paste with its key.</p>
<p>This way, the key is <strong>never</strong> transmitted to the server (or more precisely, to
the network). This ensures that the content is unbreakable if someone had
control of the server! To do this, we need to make a JavaScript script to
encrypt and send the POST request. Of course, writing JavaScript is out of the
question.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have the ability in our OCaml ecosystem to produce JavaScript
code from OCaml code! Especially since we have a library that gives us access
to cryptographic functions available from the webbrowser!</p>
<h3 id="brr"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#brr"></a><code>brr</code></h3>
<p>So I used <a href="https://github.com/dbuenzli/brr">brr</a>, fixed a little bug and produced a little script that does
all this. I'd like to give special mention to <a href="https://erratique.ch/software">dbuenzli</a> who always
makes very succinct and user-friendly APIs - which I haven't yet, but maybe one
day.</p>

<h3 id="mirageos-and-js_of_ocaml"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#mirageos-and-js_of_ocaml"></a>MirageOS and Js_of_ocaml</h3>
<p>The most difficult part is the integration with MirageOS. From a compilation
point of view, we have an element/artifact that our unikernel depends on. But
this does not happen through our cross-toolchain (Solo5) but with the host
compiler and js_of_ocaml (itself available from the host).</p>
<p>We should therefore be able to articulate <code>dune</code> (the build system of MirageOS
4) to explicitly ask to compile our <code>script.ml</code> into <code>script.js</code> using our host
toolchain (unlike our Solo5 toolchain). In dune's vocabulary, to talk about
toolchain, we talk about <code>context</code>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, MirageOS 4 offers two compilation steps, the first of which allows
us to generate dune rules that can be described in the Mirage project manifest,
the <code>config.ml</code> file.</p>
<p>We will first describe how to get our script.js file into the host context
using js_of_ocaml. Again, the integration of js_of_ocaml with <code>dune</code> has
become much simpler over time which makes the task easy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lisp">(executable
 (enabled_if (= %{context_name} &quot;default&quot;))
 (name pasteur_js)
 (modules pasteur_js)
 (libraries rresult fmt brr tyxml)
 (modes js))
</code></pre>
<p>Note especially the <code>enabled_if</code> which forces dune to produce our
<code>pasteur_js.bc.js</code> only in the host context<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p><tag id="fn1"><strong>1</strong></tag>: Indeed, compiling an OCaml script in JavaScript via
js_of_ocaml with the Solo5 toolchain makes no sense. The Solo5 toolchain
wants to correctly <strong>link</strong> OCaml objects with the Solo5 kernel. For this
purpose, the Solo5 toolchain is restrictive: no dynlink, no <code>*.so</code>, no <code>META</code>
required by <code>js_of_ocaml</code> to load <code>otherlibs/</code> which are definitely not
provided in anyway by <code>ocaml-solo5</code>.</p>
<p>From the <code>config.ml</code> file, we can describe a new &quot;device&quot;, which is an element
that can be required by our unikernel and from which we can specify a
particular dune rule.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let pasteur_js =
  let dune _info =
    [ Dune.stanzaf {dune|(subdir public
 (rule
  (enabled_if (= %%{context_name} &quot;default&quot;))
  (deps ../js/pasteur_js.bc.js)
  (target pasteur.js)
  (action (copy %%{deps} %%{target}))))|dune} ] in
  impl ~dune &quot;Pasteur_js&quot; job
</code></pre>
<p>The rule here says, still in the context of the host, to move our script into
the <code>public/</code> folder which essentially contains all the static files needed for
our website (CSS file, JavaScript, etc). This allows us to precompile our
<code>pasteur.js</code> file and then integrate it into our unikernel.</p>
<h2 id="a-read-only-filesystem"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#a-read-only-filesystem"></a>A read-only filesystem</h2>
<p>Finally, another element that may be interesting in the design of our website
is the ability to add a &quot;block-device&quot; which would be a file system containing
everything that is available in the <code>public/</code> folder.</p>
<p>So I made <a href="https://github.com/dinosaure/docteur">docteur</a>, it's a little program that generates a <code>*.disk</code>
file. This file can be added to the unikernel as an external resource. The
advantage of <code>docteur</code> is its compression ratio. If you have a lot of static
files that look alike, like for example a documentation, <code>docteur</code> offers 2
levels of compression so that 17.5 GB of HTML files can fit in a 250 MB
block-device!</p>
<p>I recently added the device to Mirage which makes it very easy to use:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">let public = docteur ~extra_deps:[ &quot;public/pasteur.js&quot; ]
  &quot;relativize://public/&quot;

let pasteur =
  foreign &quot;Unikernel.Make&quot;
    (... @-&gt; kv_ro @-&gt; job)

let () = register &quot;pasteur&quot;
  [ pasteur $ ... $ public ]
</code></pre>
<p>Docteur has the advantage of serializing into a disk file 2 sources:</p>
<ol>
<li>a simple folder (like our <code>public</code> folder)</li>
<li>a Git repository</li>
</ol>
<p>The advantage is that these sources can be available locally (like our folder)
or from the internet (like a remote Git repository). In the latter case, the
mechanism for &quot;cloning&quot; the remote source is more or less the same as a simple
<code>git clone</code>.</p>
<h2 id="paf-le-chien"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#paf-le-chien"></a><code>Paf-le-chien</code></h2>
<p>Finally, with a lot of experimentation, the abstraction proposed by Conduit
regarding the server does not seem to be a good design. Indeed, the
initialization of a server should not go through a dynamic and opaque mechanism
such as Conduit when we finally want to be explicit in what we use
(certificate, socket, port, etc.).</p>
<p>Abstraction is however required in order to inject a particular TCP/IP stack
and TLS stack. But it seems clear that, in the context of MirageOS, the
<em>functor</em> seems to be the right solution to this problem after all.</p>
<p><code>Paf</code> proposes a <em>functor</em> which allows to create several functions in order to
initialize a server according to what the user wishes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ocaml">module type S = sig
  type stack and flow and ippadr

  type t

  type dst = ipaddr * int

  val init : port:int -&gt; stack -&gt; t Lwt.t

  val http_service :
    ?config:Httpaf.Config.t -&gt;
    error_handler:(dst -&gt; Httpaf.Server_connection.error_handler) -&gt;
    (flow -&gt; dst -&gt; Httpaf.Server_connection.request_handler) -&gt;
    t Paf.service

  val https_service :
    tls:Tls.Config.server -&gt;
    ?config:Httpaf.Config.t -&gt;
    error_handler:(dst -&gt; Httpaf.Server_connection.error_handler) -&gt;
    (flow -&gt; dst -&gt; Httpaf.Server_connection.request_handler) -&gt;
    t Paf.service

  val alpn_service :
    tls:Tls.Config.server -&gt;
    ?config:Httpaf.Config.t * H2.Config.t -&gt;
    error_handler:
      (dst -&gt;
      ?request:Alpn.request -&gt;
      Alpn.server_error -&gt;
      (Alpn.headers -&gt; Alpn.body) -&gt;
      unit) -&gt;
    (dst -&gt; Alpn.reqd -&gt; unit) -&gt;
    t Paf.service

  val serve :
    ?stop:Lwt_switch.t -&gt; 't Paf.service -&gt; 't -&gt;
    [ `Initialized of unit Lwt.t ]
end

module Make (Time : Mirage_time.S) (Stack : Tcpip.Tcp.S)
  : S with type stack = Stack.t
       and type flow = Stack.flow
       and type ipaddr = Stack.ipaddr
</code></pre>
<p>The only abstraction needed is the event loop required by <code>http/af</code> and <code>h2</code> to
handle reads and writes. The latter is also available in a <em>functor</em> in the
<code>Paf</code> module and <code>Paf_mirage</code> only ceremonially provides an HTTP server from
the given TCP/IP stack and an HTTPS server from the same stack and <code>ocaml-tls</code>.
In this ceremony, there is of course the support of <code>h2</code> which is finally very
close in terms of API than <code>http/af</code>.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-iterations"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#multiple-iterations"></a>Multiple iterations</h3>
<p>The code of Paf is both very succinct and abstract which may be difficult to
understand for a novice runner but the README.md or the tests give a good
overview of its use in the context of MirageOS but also outside!</p>
<p>This shows above all that, beyond the implementations that can be found in
OCaml of this or that protocol, as far as the MirageOS projects are concerned,
a substantial API work (which can take several years) is done and leads the
overall development and maintenance of our ecosystem.</p>
<p>In this, I would like to thank <a href="https://github.com/CraigFe">CraigFe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hannesm">Hannes</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/TheLortex">Lucas</a> for helping me iterate on <code>Paf</code> several times to get closer
and closer to the right solution for HTTP servers. It also and above all shows
that an API work remains fundamentally collective since it becomes possible
only from interactions and uses.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The website is available here: <a href="https://paste.osau.re/">paste.osau.re</a>. What this article shows
is the involvement of people from the MirageOS community and elsewhere who have
added their vision directly or indirectly to the project. The development in
<em>onion layer</em> of what will allow to produce Pasteur shows the reusability of
the knowledge of each one near other software.</p>
<p>It's sharing :) ! MirageOS does not wish to offer a monolithic solution to
several problems but a scattered and immense ecosystem which can satisfy
everyone in time. As I said in the introduction, Pasteur is an experiment that
synthesizes years of work on several domains. And the crucial element to
finally build this tiny website is basically a naive interest in doing
everything in OCaml with unikernels :p !</p>
